# Personal Portfolio + Blog with Contact Form

## Overview
This project is a modern, professional web application that serves as both a personal portfolio and a blog. It is designed to showcase your software development skills, highlight your projects, share your thoughts via blog posts, and allow visitors to contact you directly through a functional contact form. The project uses a full-stack approach, combining a Python Flask backend with a responsive HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

## Key Features

1. **Landing Page**

2. **Portfolio Section**
   - Displays your projects in a clean, grid-based layout.
   - Each project card includes an image, title, description, and a link (e.g., to GitHub or a live demo).
   - Easily customizable to add or remove projects.

3. **Blog Section**
   - Dynamically lists blog posts written in Markdown format.
   - Each post is rendered as HTML for beautiful formatting, styled with Tailwind and a custom `.prose` class.

4. **Contact Form**
   - A user-friendly form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message.

## Project Structure

```
backend/
  app.py                # Main Flask application
  requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
  templates/            # Jinja2 HTML templates
    layout.html         # Base template with Tailwind and navigation
    index.html          # Home page
    portfolio.html      # Portfolio/projects
    blog.html           # Blog listing
    contact.html        # Contact form
  static/               # Static assets (JS, custom CSS, images)
    css/custom.css      # Custom styles for Markdown prose
    js/theme.js         # Dark/light mode toggle
    img/                # Project images

```

## How It Works

- **Homepage** (`/`): Shows your intro and navigation.
- **Portfolio** (`/portfolio`): Lists your projects.
- **Blog** (`/blog`): Reads all Markdown files in `blog_posts/`, converts them to HTML, and displays them with modern styling.
- **Contact** (`/contact`): Handles GET (show form) and POST (send email) requests. Uses Flask-Mail to send emails to your configured address.
- **Theming:** JavaScript toggles a CSS class for dark/light mode and saves the preference, working with Tailwind's dark mode.

## Setup & Customization

- **Configuration:**  
  - Set your email and secret key in environment variables (or `.env` file):
    - `MAIL_USERNAME` (your email )
    - `MAIL_PASSWORD` (your email password or app password)
    - `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER` (your email )
    - `SECRET_KEY` (any random string)
  - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - Run the app with `python app.py`.

- **Frontend Customization:**  
  - Edit `layout.html` for navigation, branding, and global layout.
  - Add or update your projects in `portfolio.html`.
  - Add blog posts as Markdown files in `blog_posts/`.
  - Update your name and intro in `index.html`.
  - Add or tweak custom styles in `static/css/custom.css` (for Markdown, etc.).
  - Project images go in `static/img/`.
